### Contributing

If you are keen to get involved then setup a pull request against `master`. The following updates are ideas I have in mind:

* Count-in drawn to canvas
* Support for safari and touch devices
* Fix glitchy poly-synth note off
* Lead note durations reflected on piano roll
* Add a clickable piano keyboard
* Add on/off switch to improvisation (allowing user to play instead)
* Allow user to pick chord sequence
* Add different backing styles (i.e. jazz, blues)
* Allow user to switch between different playback synths and allow playback with real audio samples
* Allow user to change the time signature
* Add rhythm/swing options
* Add reverb options to the synth
* Allow improvisation to be saved and recalled later (perhaps as midi)
* Frequency bars visualisation
